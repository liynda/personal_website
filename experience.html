<h2>DECEMBER 2018 - JUNE 2019 </h2>

<center><p style="font-size: 20px;"> My first experience in the field of employment was when I had just finished my SPM exam. At that time, I was working as a sales assistant. I learned how to make different types of drinking water such as smoothies, cofee and more. I was also taught how to make waffles. I work from 10 am to 10:30 pm. I will never forget that work experience because from there I learned a lot of experience in serving various types of customers.</p></center><br>

<center><p style="font-size: 20px;"> My second experience in work was when our country was hit by covid and at that time I had to study in ODL. I use that time as best as possible to work while studying. With that, I can reduce the burden of both my parents. I work in a cake and bakery shop. There I was taught how to work creatively. This is because, I need to write beautifully on each cake ordered by the customer. I work from 10 am to 6 pm. While working, I was also taught how to take care of the cake properly so that the quality of each product is always the same and long lasting. My place of work is not far from home so every time I have a break I will go home. </center> </p> <br>
